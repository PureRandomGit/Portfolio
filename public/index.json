[{"content":" One of the common frustrations with smart home automation is when routines trigger at inconvenient or unintended times. For example, I have daily morning and evening automations that activate at fixed times, regardless of whether anyone is actually in bed. This often means the routines either run when no one is in bed or too late after someone has already settled in, forcing me to trigger them manually.\nTo solve this, I implemented an inexpensive and reliable bed occupancy sensor. Using a compact ESP32-C3 Super Mini board combined with a long Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR), I implimented a cheap and reliable solution to detect when someone is in bed. This allows me to run my routines exactly when I want them as well as new automations such as turning on the LED strip under my bed if I get up during the night.\nHardware ESP32-C3 Super Mini Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) 10K ohm Resistor 3D-Printed Case As I often use ESP32-C3 Super Minis in a lot of my projects due to their extremely small size I had already designed a slim case for them which worked prefectly for this application. The case can be found here on my MakerWorld Profile Page.\nWiring The wiring was very simple, I just soldered one pin of the FSR to 3.3v and then the other pin to a analog pin, in my case pin 4, with the resistor connecting pin 4 and ground.\nSoftware Using Esphome I wrote a basic yaml code to publish a resistor value as well as a binary occupancy value to HomeAssistant that can be found here.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/bed-occupancy-sensor/","summary":"CLow cost bed occupancy sensor made with an esp32-c3 super mini and a $10 resistor.","title":"Bed Occupancy Sensor"},{"content":" I wanted an automated blind solution that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t rely on cloud services or expensive commercial products. By repurposing an IKEA roller shades and designing my own controller system, I was able to build a cheap local solution.\nHardware The smart blind consists of four main components:\n28BYJ-48 stepper motor ULN2003 stepper motor driver board ESP32 microcontroller IKEA roller shade I chose these because they were very cheap off of Amazon or Aliexpress and because the ULN2003 was supported by Esphome\u0026rsquo;s stepper component which I was planning on using to program the esp32.\n3D-Printed Case To mount and house the motor and eletronics I designed a 3d printed case in Fusion360. This was my first time cading gears so it took me a bit to get the correct gear ration that would allow the motor to have enough torque to raise the blinds without skipping. After that it was just a matter of blocking out where each component would go and build the case around them.\nWiring The wiring for the ULN2003 was rather straight forward and only needed 4 wires connected to the esp32 and then power and ground for both the driver and esp32\nSoftware To test that everything was working I wrote a quick arduino program to spin the motor in both directions for a few seconds. After confirming my wiring was correct and the code ran I started to write the Esphome code.

I only had to modify the code slightly to work with an esp32 but it was pretty much perfect.\nUsage \u0026amp; Future Improvements I\u0026rsquo;ve been running the blind for a little over a year now and have had no issue with it so far. There are a few things that I would change if I made a second version. First, the blinds are slow, they take over a minuet to raise/lower about 3 feet. Second, the stepper motor loses its memory of the blind position if it loses power and will need to be re-homed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/smart-blinds-v1/","summary":"Cheap, simple and effective smart blinds made from and old IKEA roller shades and a few electronic components.","title":"Smart Blinds"},{"content":"I’m a computer engineering student and developer with a focus on embedded systems, automation, and full-stack development.
