I’m a computer engineering student and developer with a focus on embedded systems, automation, and full-stack development. I enjoy designing efficient, practical solutions that bridge hardware and software — whether it's building smart home systems, programming robots, or developing custom tools to streamline workflows.

My work often combines rapid prototyping, custom electronics, 3D design, and software integration across multiple platforms. I aim to build projects that are not only functional but reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
